# Deepfake-Detection-Analysis

Objectives  - The main objective of this Project was to create an efficient system for detecting and analyzing deepfake media , particularly videos altered 
using Artificial Intelligence .

To achieve this obejctive , the system will incorporate both Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms that are designed to recognize irregularities in
media content.

Another Key is to evaluate the effectiveness of different detection models , such as CNN and RNN , in identifying deepfakes.

This system will focus on identifying patterns commonly associated with deepfake generation techniques, such as mismatch in pixel information , unnatural expressions
and audio video synchronization.Addtionally the project also aims to contribute to the broader understanding of deepfake detection technology and its implications 
for society by developing tools that can help mitigate the risks associated with manipulated media.
