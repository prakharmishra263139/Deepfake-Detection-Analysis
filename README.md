Objective
The Deepfake Analysis Project aims to develop an efficient system for detecting and analyzing deepfake media, particularly AI-altered videos. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, this project identifies subtle irregularities in media content.

Key Objectives
✔️ Detect deepfake patterns, including pixel inconsistencies, unnatural facial expressions, and audio-video mismatches.
✔️ Compare CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) for deepfake detection.
✔️ Contribute to research on deepfake detection and its societal implications.
✔️ Develop tools that help mitigate the risks of manipulated media.

Working Methodology
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
🔹 Dataset Acquisition: Use publicly available datasets (e.g., FaceForensics++) or create a custom dataset.
🔹 Data Cleaning & Augmentation: Remove corrupted data and apply rotation, flipping, and noise addition to improve model robustness.
🔹 Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values (0-1), and convert videos into image sequences.

2️⃣ Feature Extraction using CNN
🔹 Model Selection: Choose architectures like VGG, ResNet, or Inception (pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 can enhance performance).
🔹 Feature Extraction: Analyze high-level image features to differentiate between real and fake content.

3️⃣ Classification
🔹 Classifier Selection: Use models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or neural networks for classification.
🔹 Training & Validation: Split data into training and validation sets, optimize hyperparameters, and prevent overfitting.

System Architecture
📌 Data Collection & Preprocessing Module
✔️ Gathers real and fake media from datasets like FaceForensics++ and synthetic GAN-generated data.
✔️ Standardizes image sizes, frame rates, and aspect ratios for consistency.

📌 Feature Extraction Module
✔️ Uses CNNs (e.g., ResNet, InceptionNet) for spatial analysis (detecting pixel-level inconsistencies and lighting issues).
✔️ Employs RNNs (e.g., LSTMs) for temporal analysis (tracking lip synchronization and facial movement consistency).

📌 Classification Module
✔️ Classifies input as real or fake using algorithms like SVM and KNN.
✔️ Integrates extracted spatial and temporal features for high accuracy.
